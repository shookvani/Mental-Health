What is the purpose of creating this, what was the incentive to do so, and how did you do this?</div>
<div class="contenttext">
  <br>
<p>The original purpose of creating a site like this was to fully develop a mental health focused project, where algorithms would be run to understand a person and determine their health, and take it from there. This would allow one to truly understand the nuances of mental health.<br>
 However, after a failed attempt at setting up a proper UI in Java, I started over and decided to go with the language that would allow me to recreate this. That's when I created the mental health quiz using HTML, CSS, and JS. As I completed it, I realized that many people take such quizzes, and then proceed to not really know what to do with them. This is when the rest of the site was born. One can take their results, understand what they are, and then get it applied to their personalities using their scores. </p>  <br>
  <p>The incentive to create this is following my interests in mental health. After publishing a paper in BD last year (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biochem2010001"> here </a>), I felt that it was important that this aspect of life was heard by the public. I originally wanted to create just a mental health quiz. However, my research from then and my research now for my final English-history paper reminded me that there are so many different aspects of life. The environmental aspect. The genetic aspect. There are aspects that identify a person as them and that can translate into one's mental health. There are so many different reasons why someone may have depression or anxiety and it is unique to each and every person. With this, I decided to create multiple quizzes to allow them to merge and explain how this may come to be.My current paper that I'm working on details this, which you can read <a href="">here</a>. (Will be posted when done with paper)</p><br>

  <p>This is a pretty straightforward website. Take the quizzes, remember your results, put them into the combo, and get an understanding of who you are!</p>

  <p> Disclamer: I am not a medical professional, and this is based on some knowledge and research. Quizzes may not be 100% accurate.</p>
