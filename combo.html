<p><strong>WHAT'S MY PET </strong>  <br>- If you got a dog, you may be someone who has a strong heart and is energetic. Dogs are known to be everlasting companions, so you must be a great friend as well. <br> - If you got a cat, you are the direct opposite of your dog counterparts! This is <i>not</i> a bad thing. You tend to be on the calmer side of things, but you remain loyal. Cats are best known to "have 9 lives" showcasing your determination. <br>- If you got rabbit, you may be calm, but still willing to go out, have fun, and more. You are both energetic and calm, just as if you were the "mom" of your group. Maybe not, but you are still there for everyone. <br> -  If you got birds you are somewhat energetic. Similar to your rabbit counterparts, although you may be energetic and light, you tend to be somewhat calm as well. </p> 
  <p><strong>INTROVERT OR EXTROVERT</strong> <br> - If you got an introvert, well hey, you're an introvert! Don't worry, this does <i>not</i> mean that you are necessarily separate from society or should be looked down upon. Introverts still have wonderful people, and although they may look aloof on the outside, they have a great time with their closest friends and use their minds to do beautiful things. Sometimes, introverts are just waiting for someone else to break the silence. <br> - If you got an extrovert, congrats! You are a bubbly person, and outgoing. You help everyone around you and that makes you a wonderful and charming person. Extroverts help their introvert counterparts by breaking the silence, and their minds can help bring in some important ideas. <br> - If you got an ambivert, do not fret! Many people may think that this bad. However, ambiverts are unique combinations of introverts and extroverts. On the MBTI, this may mean although you may lean towards either I or E, the actual number is close to 50%, and after taking the test multiple times you may be switching between the two. Use this combination to hide or speak up! </p>
  <p><strong>WHAT MUSIC</strong> - This is the most straightforward response of them all. Depending on what you got (grunge/dark/etc., mix, light/soft), it corresponds to your personality. Dark music, although contains rap, is a lot of acoustic music, "sad music", and not as much EDM as compared to other songs. You may be a calm person, and if not, you're outgoing personality hides this unique part of yourself â€” listening to music that "may not fit you" or others "would be suprised" that you do so. <br> - The same goes for the soft music. Although people who listen to this type of music are typically outgoing, a person who's typically aloof/calm may have this energetic, passionate side to themselves. <br> - The mix just allows one to listen to a wide variety of music, and you don't let your personality define it. <br> - The different songs that are listed in the pop window are various recommendations based on the style of music you got. Check some of them out! </p>
  <p><strong>MENTAL HEALTH</strong> - This is also one of the more straight forward tests. If you got a score above 0, hey, you're doing well, and keep doing what you are doing! <br> - If you got a 0, then you kind of flucuate between the two, and maybe something bad just happened. Either way, it is worth meditating for a bit to clear your mind. <br> - Finally, the rest is when you are deemed "mentally unwell." Don't panic. Perhaps, you want to talk to someone, whomever that may be. If you need help, reach out to someone, ASAP! </p>
  <p><strong>THAT SCORE NUMBER</strong> Each one of the options in the quizzes are given a value. At the end, these values are added up. To find your average number, add all of the values up, subtract 2 (if you did the pet one), and then divide by the number of quizzes you did. You can think of them in the same way as one would the MBTI percentages/score.</p>
